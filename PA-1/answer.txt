1. Create files of varying sizes and record the time it takes to transfer them. Visualize the execution time vs file size. Does the trend make sense?

1KB: 0.001s
50KB: 0.026s
1024KB: 0.524s
51200KB: 26.214s

Once visualized, the execuation time vs file size graph shows a positive, linear relationship.
This trend makes sense because we can expect the execution time to grow as file size grows.
The linearality can be explained by the fact that we always
do the same amount and duration of work for each "trip" to transfer the files.


2. What is the main bottleneck that stops the code from transferring files faster? Describe in one or two sentences

The main bottleneck is the small message size limit of 256 bytes, 
which forces the system to break large files into hundreds of thousands of small chunks. 
Each chunk requires a complete round-trip communication (a request + response), 
so a 100MB file needs >500,000 separate rount-trip messages, 
making the transfer slower.
